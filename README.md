Purpose: This is an app that sends an email alert whenever rain is expected in a certain location within 24 hours. 

Target Audience: People that need to know what the weather will be like but do not often check for the weather. Minimalist types that don't want a glut of apps on their phone, but interact with their email on a daily basis. Outdoor commuters(ie cyclist, walkers, bus riders, etc) who need to know the weather in order to prepare the right gear. 

Enjoy.

User Instructions:
1) Set up requires you to put in your email of choice.
2) Set your location (GPS, coordinates, choose your location on a map, or city/zip)

Steps to Build:

2) Connect app to a public weather API.
3) Create a way to allow users to pick their weather alerts by their live GPS location, coordinates, pin on a map, or enter city/zip code)
